ðŸ“¦ Supply Chain Management | Machine Learning & Data Analytics

This project explores Supply Chain Management (SCM) using data analytics, forecasting, and machine learning techniques to optimize operations across demand, inventory, suppliers, and logistics. The dataset (from a Fashion & Beauty startup) captures critical features such as product type, pricing, stock levels, lead times, order quantities, shipping costs, supplier details, manufacturing volumes, and defect rates.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Trends in demand, revenue, stock levels, and lead times.

Supplier performance, cost distribution, and transportation routes.

Insights into risks, sustainability, and efficiency metrics.

Machine Learning for Demand Forecasting:

Built a Neural Network model to predict product demand.

Engineered time-based features (Month, Day of Week, Quarter).

Achieved reliable predictions with low Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Optimization & Decision-Making:

Identified cost drivers in shipping & manufacturing.

Suggested strategies for inventory planning & supplier selection.

Highlighted peak demand periods to reduce stockouts.

Visualization & Dashboard:

Created interactive Streamlit dashboard for real-time monitoring.

Visualized KPIs like production volumes, stock levels, lead times, and transportation modes.

Accessible online for exploratory analysis.

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack

Python: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

SQL & Excel for data handling and analysis

Streamlit for interactive dashboards

ðŸ”¹ Outcomes

Accurate demand forecasting model to improve planning.

Actionable insights for cost reduction, supplier optimization, and risk management.

Dashboard-enabled decision-making for supply chain efficiency.

ðŸ“Š This project demonstrates how data-driven SCM can empower businesses to streamline operations, minimize costs, and enhance customer satisfaction.
